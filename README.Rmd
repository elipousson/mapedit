Interactive editing of spatial data in R | an [RConsortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) funded [project](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/awarded-projects).  For additional detail, please see the original [proposal](https://github.com/environmentalinformatics-marburg/mapview_toolchain/blob/master/mapview_interactive_data_manipulation.Rmd).

### Status

`mapedit` is still in active development.  We would very much appreciate feedback, ideas, and use cases.  The API has stabilized, and we will use semantic versioning with Github tagged releases to track changes and progress.  All changes will also be documented in NEWS.md.

### Install

As the CRAN badge above indicates, `mapedit` has achieved CRAN status.  To install, please use `install.packages`, or for the cutting edge, use `pak::pkg_install`.

```
install.packages("mapedit")
# cutting edge
# pak::pkg_install("r-spatial/mapedit@develop")
```

### Examples

We can interactively CRD (create, update, delete) features on a map with `editMap`.

```
library(mapedit)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)

editMap(leaflet() %>% addTiles())

editMap(
  mapview(breweries91),
  targetLayerId = "breweries91"
)
```

`mapedit` also offers interactive selection of map features with `selectMap`.

```
library(mapedit)
library(leaflet)
library(mapview)

selectMap(
  leaflet(breweries91) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addCircleMarkers(layerId = ~brewery)
)
```
